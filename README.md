Remweb
======

This is a really basic web frontend to unix calendaring program Remind (http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind).

It displays the calendar as generated by rem2html, and a textarea below it to edit the reminders file. The miniature calendars for the previous and next months can be clicked to switch months.

I whipped this up quickly for my own use, and am releasing it in case it can be useful to someone. I might improve it a bit (see todo list below), but it mostly suits my needs as is, so don't count on it too much.

todo list
---------
- nicer CSS
- better month navigation
- clickable calendar events that scroll the textarea to the right line
- highlighting of the current date
